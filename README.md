# Note Taker

## Description

Note Taker is an application that is used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end that saves and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The applicationâ€™s front end was already created/provided, I build the back end, connected the two, and then deployed the entire application to Heroku (see link below).
